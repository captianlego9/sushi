            Place of origin
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sushi; believed to have been invented around the second century, was invented to help preserve fish. Originating out of Southeast Asia, narezushi (salted fish) was stored in vinegerated or fermented rice for anywhere up to a year!

        <h2>
            History of Sushi
        </h2>
        <p>
            As with many ancient foods, the history of Sushi is surrounded by legends and folklore. In an ancient Japanese wivesÂ’ tale, an elderly woman began hiding her pots of rice in osprey nests, fearing that thieves would steal them. Over time, she collected her pots and found the rice had begun to ferment. She also discovered that fish scraps from the osprey's meal had mixed into the rice. Not only was the mixture tasty, the rice served as a way of preserving the fish, thus starting a new way of extending the shelf life of seafood.
